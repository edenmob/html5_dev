    <h2> HTML5 : BUILD IT AND THEY WILL COME </h2>
    <p>
      You're excited about HTML5; we are too. You've not just been enjoying the HTML5-powered web already â€” you're building it! As adoption and inspiration spreads, the web community will find creative ways to apply HTML5 and related technologies, spark trends, and capture best practices. As momentum builds, we hope you bring this logo along for the ride and paint the world orange.

      You know that HTML5 badge you've placed oh-so perfectly in your footer? That HTML5 T-shirt turning heads in the office? Those HTML5 stickers on your laptop and that HTML5 logo you shaved into your head? We want to see it! Show us your screenshots, photos, and other creative endeavors and they might end up right here in our HTML5ivers Gallery.
